      Welcome! Whether you are brand new to the fishkeeping hobby or returning after a few years, this guide is a great resource for learning how to care for your aquatic friends. A community tank is a great option for people who want to enjoy a variety of different fish. In addition to covering tank setup and maintenance, Iâ€™ve focused on a handful of popular fish species known for their peaceful nature and heartiness - perfect for a beginner. With the right knowledge and a little patience, fishkeeping can be extremely fun and rewarding.
